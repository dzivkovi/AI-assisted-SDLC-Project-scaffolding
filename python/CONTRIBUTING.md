### **[TODO FOR CPO/CTO]**

This document will be expanded to define the internal development standards for the Magma Inc. team.

**Topics to define before scaling the team:**

* **[TODO]** Define our Git branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow, GitHub Flow).
* **[TODO]** Define our Pull Request (PR) and code review process.
* **[TODO]** Define coding standards (e.g., formatting, linting rules).
* **[TODO]** Define how we manage dependencies and security.
* **[TODO]** Define our policy for updating the `StoryBreakdown.md` and `PRD.md` documents.
